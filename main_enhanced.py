Enhanced Doctor Prescription OCR - Main Entry Point

This is the main script that orchestrates the complete workflow:
1. Load and preprocess the prescription image (with resizing, sharpening, adaptive thresholding)
2. Extract text using enhanced OCR with confidence scores
3. Display and save the results with confidence metrics
4. Generate comparison images (original vs processed)

Project Structure:
- images/           : Folder containing prescription images to process
- output/           : Folder where extracted text results and comparisons are saved
- preprocess.py     : Enhanced image preprocessing module
- ocr.py            : Enhanced OCR text extraction module with confidence reporting
- requirements.txt  : Python package dependencies

Usage:
    python main_enhanced.py          # Will process images from images/ folder
    
New Features:
    - Image resizing for consistent OCR
    - Image sharpening for better text definition
    - Adaptive thresholding for varying lighting
    - Confidence score reporting from Tesseract
    - Before/after image comparisons
